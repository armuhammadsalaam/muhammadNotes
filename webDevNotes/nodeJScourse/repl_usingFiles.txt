- The REPL:
	- access the REPL by typing command 'node' in terminal.
	- terminal tool for writing and executing nodejs code:
	- (R)ead -> read user input.
	- (E)valuate -> evaluate user input.
	- (P)rint -> Print Output (Result).
	- (L)oop -> Wait for new input.
	
- The REPL command line interface does not save any lines of code; persists only for that particular session.
	- used mainly for quick testing for a few lines of code
	- executes the code as it's passed in.

- Running/Executing Node.js Code:

	- The main-stream method for running nodejs code is by using a text editor to write code to a file, then execute that file by means of an executable program.
 	- Executable files comprise the entire functionality of real apps.
	- Can be executed repeatedly, with a predictable sequence of steps.
	- Write the code in advance.
