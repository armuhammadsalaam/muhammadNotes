- JavaScript Summary:

- Weakly typed language;	does not require explicit type assignment; does
				not force you to define which type of variable
				you use when declaring a variable or function.
				Data types can be switched dynamically. Be mindful
				not to create errors when working with multiple
				data types.

- Object Oriented Language;	Data can be organized into logical objects.
				Primitive vs reference object types. Please refer
				to documentation for more details.

- Versatile language;		JS typically runs in a browser, can also run on pc
				and server. JS can perform a wide range of tasks.
