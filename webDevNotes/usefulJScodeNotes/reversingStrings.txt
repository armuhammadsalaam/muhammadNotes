refer to the sample code below for an example on how to reverse a string:


function reverseString(str) {
  return str
    .split("")
    .reverse()
    .join("");
}

	- split the string by characters using .split(""); leave quotes empty makes function split the string by each character
	- using the .split() function will turn the string into an array of characters, keep that in mind as we move forward.
	- chain the .revers() function; takes array of characters and reverses them.
	- chain .reverse() function which takes our array of characters and reverses them
	- chain .join("") to put all characters back together into a string; do not pass in any spaces in the argument for join function; this makes sure that the array of characters is joined back together by each character
