Aligning elements;

Center text within an element. In the body element, text-align affects all text in body
that does not have a width propery. Text align will affect elements within the parent
element/container.

	text-align: value;

To change the alignment of a list, place the list in a <div></div> and add text align propery:value; Use class attribute to change CSS styling for that div.

/* Another option to center elements in the body is by manipulating the margins. When adding values to margins around an element,
the input goes clock-wise around the margin ex: margin: top right bottom left ; where each argument is a value for the margin on 
that particular side */


To center the ul and also have the li elements centered in it as well, and make the width of the ul change dynamically, use display: inline-block; and wrap it in a centered div.


See example below for CSS styling and div construction:

<style type="text/css">
    .wrapper {
        text-align: center;
    }
    .wrapper ul {
        display: inline-block;
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
        /* For IE, the outcast */
        zoom:1;
        *display: inline;
    }
    .wrapper li {
        float: left;
        padding: 2px 5px;
        border: 1px solid black;
    }
</style>

<div class="wrapper">
    <ul>
        <li>Three</li>
        <li>Blind</li>
        <li>Mice</li>
    </ul>
</div>

				bottom margins set to 0 while right and left set to auto

** refer to margin mdn web documentation for full margin functionality. **

To manipulate an img element and remove it from the in-line HTML default flow, use the
"position: absolute;" CSS style to change the image position

Be sure to keep styles.css sheet minimal at first to change one element at a time. Start 
by adding styles to the body. position: absolute; style will use body as parent element.
use position: relative; in the parent element then add position: absolute; to the element
that needs positioning around the page.
