File Transfer Protocol:

	- before download links: FTP
	- uses port 21
	- need FTP client
		- every web browser is an ftp client
		- FileZilla
		- works like cloud storage
		- ftp server:
			- type in ip address or domain
			- type in port 21 or other number
			- click connect
			- allows file transfer from client to remote ftp server
			- click and drag over using FileZilla
			- can make folders etc
			- passive mode: everything is done on port 21
				- ftp request goes out on port 21
				- server sends it back 
			- active mode: 
				- client sends ftp request on port 21
				- server sends back on port 20
				- most routers will block this
				- 5x faster than passive mode
				- home routers will block incoming port 20 because client did not initiate port 20 communication
				- port triggering:
					- just for ftp
					- navigate to port triggering settings at router settings
					- name the application
					- set triggering port number
					- set triggering protocol to all
					- allow external port number
					- set external protocol to all
			- active ftp is an example of port triggerings
				- games, specialty apps etc
			- if an application requires port triggering, the software will notify you during the setup process

RECAP:

	- File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is used to transfer files from one system to another
	- You need an FTP client: almost all Web browsers are also FTP clients
	- FTP uses TCP port 21 in passive mode and TCP ports 20 and 21 in active mode
	- active mode FTP require the router to use port triggering to allow port 20 incoming.
