TROUBLESHOOTING WIRELESS CONNECTIONS:

	- Common errors:
		- useful to have a wifi analyzer ex wifiman
		- no connectivity:
			- some SSID that doesn't exist; changed name or password
		- low RF signal:
			- get closer to SSID
			- inspect antennaes
			- point all antennaes straight upward
		- if broadcasting is turned off for a particular SSID, you will need to know precise name of SSID, security type and password to acces the WAP
		- limited connectivity / no connectivity:
			- slow transfer speeds, interference
			- low RF signal
		- intermittent connectivity:
			- connection spotty/ in and out
			- low RF signal
			- too many connections on a single WAP
			- QOS
			- set up particular ports for specific uses
RECAP:
	- exam will list specific wireless erros
	- wifi analyzers are very helpful to diagnose wireless problems
	- memorize fixes for the wireless problems
