Implementing mass storage for first time on a blank drive:

	- format the mass storage device during the installation process
	- installation begins after formatting the storage device
	- linux install process also gives options for custom partitions / formatting
	- partitioning / formatting always on a new storage device
	- any OS installation process usually includes as formatting/partitioning feature
	- the first drive on a system relies on the OS install program to provide partition and format functions
	- the partitioning and formatting tools in  installation programs provide a subset of tools when compared with their main tools
	- installation tools may provide features not normally seen anywhere else (such as swap file creation) 

RAID:

	- redundant array of inexpensive disks (RAID) 
	- provide speed and data redundancy
	- raid levels:
		- raid 0 / striping : minimum 2 drives; stores pieces of each file throughout each storage device in the RAID setup until the file is completely saved
		- there are multiple drives accessing the data; good for speed
		- if either of the device dies, you lose all data
		- raid 1 / mirroring: 2 drives, can configure with 4 drives
			- store copies of pieces of file in each device; redundancy / safety
			- slower bc it writes the same piece of data at the same time
		- raid 5 / striping with parity: minimum of 3 drives needed; 
			- take pieces of each file and write them between the first 2 drives;
			- the 3rd device creates a parity value of the same size as the stored pieces of data
			- if any of the drives dies, use the parity value to restore the data
			- downside is that you can only lose 1 drive to be able to recover data; loss of more than 1 drive is loss of data
		- raid 6 / creates 2 parity values per piece of data; can lose up to two drives before loss of data; more redundancy 
		- can use multiple levels of RAID at once:
		- RAID 10 / striping mirrors: minimum of 2 pairs of drives 4 total:
			- 2 separate pairs of mirrored drives in raid 1: this configuration will take a piece of data and mirror it across the first pair, then striping and mirroring on the next pair of drives i.e stripe the two mirrored pairs
			- can lose one of the mirrored pair from each separate pair without loss of data; if both drives in either of the mirrored pairs are lost, there is loss of data.
		- RAID 0 + 1 / mirror the stripes: requires a minimum of 2 pairs of drives; this configuration mirrors the stripes being created by the memory allocation
			- takes a piece of data to each drive of the striped pair, then mirrors the piece of data in each drive to the second striped pair of drives: the two striped pairs are mirrored.
			- able to lose a complete striped pair of drives without data loss; losing one on each side causes data loss
	
HOW TO SET UP RAID:
	- RAID hardware: plug drives into a RAID controller on the motherboard and configure RAID type through the system setup or the BIOS
	- RAID software: most operating systems support some level of RAID built in
	- propriety RAIDs built by particular computer companies.

- RAID provides speed and/or redundancy
- RAID 0 (striping) provides speed
- RAID 1 (mirroring) provides redundancy
- RAID 5 and 6 (striping with parity) provides speed and redundancy
- RAID 5 can only lose one drive in the array; 
- RAID 6 can lose two


HARDWARE RAID:

- have to change the system setup for drives to be recognized as a RAID array and not regular mass storage
- CTRL - R during boot to access RAID array configurations


- hardware RAID requires a controller to configure the RAID arrays
- hardware RAID has its own BIOS that comes with a special system setup to configure the RAID array
- the completed array looks like a single drive to the operating system

MASS STORAGE TROUBLESHOOTING:

- back up your mass storage
- mental reinstall
- triple check; 

examples of problems to troubleshoot:

- RAID not found / RAID not working:
	- make sure RAID controllers are active; correct drivers for the system
	- check the RAID configurations in system setup
	- make sure everything is connected properly and that everything has power
	- check power, connections, mental reinstall

- read/write failure:
	- S.M.A.R.T: built into all hard drives; small program that checks the health status of all system hard drives.
	- usually end up replacing the drive 

- slow performance:
	- check your RAM usage

- loud clicking:
	- terminal error with no solution; replace hdd

- failure to boot:
	- check boot order
	- use system recovery tools 

- drive not recognized:
	- formatting issue
	- re-format the drive 
	- initialize the disk before OS recognizes it

- OS not found:
	- check the boot process 
	- go into system setup to check boot order

- attempts to boot incorrect device:
	- check boot order in system setup

- continuous reboots:
	- check OS system setup
	- troubleshoot the OS on start-up
	- everything runs on a controller; check to see if all controllers are enabled


- many troubleshooting questions on the EXAM

- always back up important data before troubleshooting mass storage
- use a mental process of installation to make sure all the installation steps have taken place


- a dedicated RAID controller comes in the form of an expansion card. Storage Spaces is a Microsoft software RAID implementation. Dynamic and basic disks are not RAID controllers

- the most likely result of a corrupt operating system is continuous reboots. Boot order is set in the UEFI.BIOS system setup utility. A corrupt OS can cause crashes and reboots, not slow performance. Hard drive clicking comes from a mechanical failure inside the hard drive.
