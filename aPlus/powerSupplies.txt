POWER SUPPLIES:
	- ATX style power supply is the most common used in desktop PCs
	- has a kill switch in the back
	- may have voltage selector slider/switch
	- exhaust fan air goes out through the power supply
	- step down transformers that convert DC to AC
	- ATX power connector in 2 pieces
		- 20 and 4 pin two pieces on connector
	- yellow is 12 volt
	- red is 5 volt
	- orange is 3.3 volt
	- ATX12V extensions that allow more power to the motherboard
	- some mother boards need 1 or 2 
	- Molex connector -> older style plug for power supply
	- Mini-connectors used to connect floppy drives
	- SATA power connecter
	- PCIe connectors usually for video cards
	- modular power supplies allow for only the power cables you need
	
	- Power supplies transform AC from wall outlet to DC fr the computer 
	- Standard connectors for motherboard are 20-24 pin ATX and 4-8 pin P4
	- Use Molex and SATA connectors for peripherals and drives
	- the ATX 12v power connectors send power to the CPU. The other devices get power from the main power connector
	- Efficiency is a primary characteristic to be considrd when choosing a powr supply
	- liquid cooling is the quietest solution 


MOUNTING A POWER SUPPLY:

	- usually comes out the back of the system
	- some system unit cases have separate compartment for power supply with its own cooling
	- screw into back of case depending on mounting features of the actual case
	- ATX power supplies blow heat out the back
	- use cable management through holes if you can
	- Connect the main motherboard connector as well as any power for other peripherals / hardware in the system
	
	- munt power supply in case with four screws
	- orient the power supply so fans draw air from the system unit
	- connect motherboard primary and secondary power
	- modular PSUs offer less cable clutter than non-modular PSUs

CHOOSING A POWER SUPPLY:
	
	- different wattages for different power supplies
	- different system wattages for different set ups
	- maximum wattage is only used when all hardware that requires the power is running at full capacity
	- the power supply only delivers power as needed
	- power supply companies use the 80 plus rating system to declare the efficiency of at least 80% or higher for their power supply products
	- standard ATX size power supply is useful for a majority of systems
	
	- get a PSU with a little more wattage than your system needs
	- Shop for higher-efficiency power supplies
	- modular power supplies cut down on cable clutter
  	- efficiency is a primary characteristic when choosing a power supply
	

COOLING YOUR PC:
	
	- main dissipation of heat is through the heat sink first then to the cooling fins and fan
	- pull cool air from the front and the top of system and force it out through the bottom and rear of system unit (usually by the power supply) 
	- make sure not to block good air flow for fans to moev the heat
	- an over heating system will reboot
	- PWM connectors go from the motherboard to the fan so as to regulate the fans directly per the system's needs

	- a heat sink draws heat from electrical components
	- fans blow heated air through and out of the stystem
	- fans speed and noise can be controlled through firmware or software (system setup or through a desktop app)
	- liquid cooling is the quietest solution for cooling a PC

TROUBLESHOOTING POWER SUPPLIES:

	- power supply is the most common component to wear out / die first
	- test the power supply to determine its life / life span left
	- use a power supply tester by plugging it into the main ATX power connector
	- all power supplies come over volted from the factory
	- lower than rated voltage is a sign of slow death, but system can still run a volt or two below the rated voltage
	- test the voltages on a motherboard with the power supply by using a multimeter V~ = AC / V~ ... = DC
		- check to see the output of the probes on the multimeter; reading should match the rating for the plug i.e 12v 5.5v 3.3v etc
		- good way to see if the power supply needs to be replaced

	- power supplies die fas twith burning smell, smoke, or both.
	- power supllies die slowly and cause intermittent problems (lower power outputs, random reboots etc)
	- use PSU tester or multimeter to test power supplies
	- CPU overheating causes shutdowns and rebots. Overheating does not increase or decrease performance. Overheating does not cause fans to spin faster

TROUBLESHOOTING CORE COMPONENTS:

	- make sure CPU is mounted correctly
	- make sure RAM is installed in the correct channel per the motherboard book
	- make sure the motherboard supports the correct type of graphics
	- if there is any error after the initial system unit set up, take out all connections and reassemble the whole system unit from the beginning
	- system lockups call for use of clear CMOS jumper to erase system setup and resets to factory defaults
	- LEDs on the motherboards signal status for components throughout the sytem
	- refer to the motherboard book to see what indicator lights mean to trouble shoot the components
	- in the case of bad RAM sticks, use memory checking program / live storage OS for system recovery
	- if power supply emits smoke or catches fire, immediately unplug and replace
	- incorrectly installed CPUs or RAM can make it seem like your PC is dead
	- Install core components and test before mounting into the case
	- Errors is System Setup can cause a dead PC; try cleaning the CMOS jumper
	- windows offers memory diagnostic tools to help with potentially bad RAM
	- if installed RAM does not show up in the CMOS setup program, re-seat the RAM sticks into the correct channels per the motherboard book
