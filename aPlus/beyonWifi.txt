Other connections besides WiFi:

	- Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
		- popular in warehouses, industrial settings, etc
		- small sticker that stores information
		- scanner to powerup sticker and read the info
		- among individual users, this technology is referred to as:
			- NFC (Near Field Communication)
			- ex laser printer (tap to print)
			- tap-to-pay
			- same as RFID
	- BluTooth:
		- main difference from 802.11: 
			- blutooth designed to connect only two devices at one time in a Personal Area Network (PAN) environment
		- comes in 3 classes:
			1. power 100mW range 100m
			2. 2.5mW range 10m
			3. 1mW range 1m 
		- pairing:
			- turn on blutooth
			- turn on other device
			- start pairing
			- set first device in discoverable mode
			- some need to pair with pin
	- RFID is slower and low power; scanner as a reader

RECAP:
	- RFID uses tiny radios activated by ythe energy of the scanning device
	- NFC requires close proximity to function
	- Bluetooth is like 802.11 but pairs with devices to function as point-to-point
