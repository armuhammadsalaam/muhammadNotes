LOCAL AREA NETWORKING:


* TCP / IP:
   * Ex: 10.11.12.13
   * Identify LAN
   * Identify HOST ID
   * Class C: 210.11.12.x
      * 254 hosts
   * Class B: 172.16.x.x
      * 65,534 hosts
   * Class A: 6.x.x.x
      * Millions of hosts
* 4 characters go from 0-255
* A dot between each of the numbers ( 3 dots total)
   * Addresses do not end in 0 or 255
* Use routers as gateway to internet
   * Give an ip address
   * Give it a subnet mask
   * Give it a default gateway (router)


* ARPANET formed as foundation of the internet
* TCP/IP adopted as protocol for ARPANET/Internet
* IP addresses have four octets between 0-255
* Classful address scheme for locations and sublocations




NETWORK IDs and SUBNET MASKS


* “Network and Sharing Center”
   * Change adapter settings
      * Properties:
         * Internet protocol version 4 (IPV4)
         * Use custom addresses
         * Use similar numbers for router
   * Static IP address


* Use Network and sharing center for setting up network information
* Set IP address, subnet mask, and gateway in Ethernet Properties
* Manual settings = static IP address
* 255 in a subnet mask is part of the network address


SPECIAL IP ADDRESSES:


* Class D: multicast
   * Popular in presentation software / presentation applications
* Class E: Reserved
   * Not common for civilian use


* Private IP Address:
   * Commonly used in private home networks:
      * Class A: 10.x.x.x
      * Class B: 172.16.x.x -> 172.31.x.x
      * Class C: 192.168.x.x
   * Only for private networks
* Loopback IP Address:
   * 127.0.0.1
   * Refers to your own system
   * Use ping command followed by loopback to ping your system
      * Test the network card on your system
   * Ipconfig (windows) ifconfig(linux/MacOS) will show all relevant network addresses on your system
   * Ping your router to check if it is active on the network
   * ipconfig/all -> shows more relevant network address info
   * Ping -t address: keeps pinging indefinitely
      * To test multiple switches/panels


* Class D addresses for multicast (224.x.x.x)
* Class E addresses reserved (240.x.x.x)
* Three sets of private IP addresses (10, 172.16 - 172.31, 192.168.x.x)
* Loopback addresses for self-reference (127.x.x.x)


NAT:
* Network Address Translation:
   * Removes the private IP address from computer sending data
   * Changes it to LAN public IP address


* Network address translation (NAT) saves IP addresses
* With NAT, internal networks use private IP addresses and share a public address with WAN
* All gateway routers are NAT-enabled by default
* Networks that use NAT are invisible to the public Internet




DYNAMIC IP ADDRESSING:


* Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP):
   * Many home routers also act as DHCP servers
   * Automatically configures all IP addresses; even when using on another LAN
   * DHCP server has its own IP address
* Automatic private IP addressing (APIPA)
   * Fallback in case the computer cannot find a DHCP server
   * Always gives a 169.254.x.x (class B)
   * Denotes a DHCP server problem; won’t be able to get on internet with APIPA alone
   * Ipconfig /renew command re-initiates the DHCP server so you get useable IP addresses on your system
   * Ipconfig /release command disconnects your system from the DHCP server
   * Ipconfig /renew to connect your system to the DHCP server
* Right-click on network icon at the bottom right in order to run built-in network troubleshooter; runs above commands on your system to get your system re-connected to the internet
* You can configure your own private IP address without APIPA; recommended only for specific purposes; setting APIPA enabled is good default behavior to see if you are ever disconnected from DHCP server


* Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) automatically assigns IP information to hosts
* Gateway routers commonly are DHCP servers for their internal LANs
* If a DHCP client can’t find the DHCP server, it will use an APIPA address
* Use the ipconfig /renew command to force a new connection to the DHCP server


IPv6:
* Solution to having run out of IPv4 addresses; 4 billion
* 8 groups of 4 characters separated by colons
* Use shorthand by removing leading zeros and condensing 3 zeros in a row into a double colon ::
* Link-local address:
   * Fe80:0000:0000:0000:[last half is auto-generated]
* Internet address: (global unicast address)
   * Run ipconfig to list IPv6 address information
   * Still have ipv4 addresses
* Every system has 1 main IPv6 address but they can temporarily make different ones as needed for multiple processes
* Recognize IPv4 vs IPv6 addresses
* IPv6 prefix length fixed at /64
   * Talk to upstream routers faster


* IPv6 addresses use a 128-bit addressing scheme
* IPv6 addresses use a hexadecimal notation
* IPv4 addresses are 32 bits long
* Link-local addresses are used for local connections
* Global unicast addresses are used to connect to the internet




PORT NUMBERS:


* Client-server interactions (browser is a client that requests information from servers)
   * Servers use Internet Information Service (IIS) to hold then send out information
* Domain Name System (DNS): holds all web-page addresses
* IP address gets you to the computer; Port number gets you to the correct application
   * range : 0-65535
   * Always have a source and destination port number
   * Server will listen on a particular port for information requests from clients
      * Servers use multiple ports to deal with multiple processes/ requests at once
      * Ex: each tab on a browser will have its own port number
   * Can use software like “resource manager” to keep track of network traffic/activity
      * A single web page can use multiple port numbers depending on the needs of the website/page
* Different categories of port numbers:
   * 0-1023: Well-known ports
      * Major web applications/services are most common 
   * 1024-49151: Registered ports
      * Popular/common web services with major traffic that have dedicated port numbers
         * Ex: “Steam” has its own registered ports
   * 49152-65535: Dynamic/Ephemeral
      * Your system will use a dynamic port number to return your web-service requests (receiving end at your system)
* List of common port numbers that will be on the Exam:
   * 21-FTP
   * 22-SSH
   * 23-TELNET
   * 25-SMTP
   * 53-DNS
   * 80-HTTP
   * 110-POP3
   * 161/162-SNMP
   * 143-IMAP
   * 443-HTTPS
   * 3389-RDP
   * 137-139-NETBIOS/BETBT
   * 445-SMB/CIFS
   * 427-SLP
   * 548-AFP
   * 67-68-DHCP
   * 389-LDAP
* IP addresses get you to the right computer, PORT NUMBERS get you to the right application


* Port numbers get data to the correct application
* There is always a source and destination port number
* Resource monitor shows the connections on a system
* Memorize all ports numbers listed on the exam








TCP UDP ICMP:


* Protocol: standardized processes for job completion
* Internet operates using transmission control protocol / internet protocol (TCIP/IP)
   * 2 protocols work together to handle information traffic to your system
* TCP: connection-oriented protocol
   * client - server process with handshake
* UDP: non-connection protocol
   * No handshake required
* ICMP: single-packet only
   * Simple, small processes
   * Ex: ping command uses ICMP protocol
* Protocol data unit (PDU):
   * Breaks down the ethernet frame to use only the chunks that are needed for the server request
   * Server requests focus on the IP packet
   * Data section of IP packet is the content of interest; what the server request is made to retrieve:
      * Known as the TCP segment / UDP datagram


* Transmission control protocol (TCP) is connection-oriented and sends multiple packets
* User datagram protocol (UDP) is connectionless, but also sends multiple packets
* Internet control message protocol ICMP is connectionless and always sends a single packet
* We organize packets by protocol data units (PDUs)




Understanding DNS:


* Domain name system (DNS);
   * Resolves web address names to corresponding IP address
   * Replaced host file system in the mid90s
   * Exists on a network of powerful  DNS servers: root servers
      * First level domains: .com .edu .gov
      * Second level domains: totalsem.com google.com DNS server
      * When first visiting a webpage, the DNS process takes a moment longer than usual because it has not been cached on your system yet
* Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN):
   * Register a unique name
   * Usually involves paying a domain name server service provider
   * 256 character limit for the name
   * Domain Name System (DNS) resolves fully-qualified domain names (FQDN)
   * DNS replaced hosts files
   * DNS uses a hierarchical organization to resolve FQDNs to IP addresses
   * All internet-connected hosts have a DNS server


Working with DNS:


* Provided by DHCP server:
   * Ipconfig /all
* To statically configure DNS:
   * Network and sharing center; change adapter setting
      * Ethernet properties
      * IPV4 properties
      * Set DNS server address automatically or set statically by typing in the address
* DNS connections go in an out:
   * Manually configure each time
   * Put in 2 DNS servers:
      * 8.8.8.8 or 8.8.4.4
      * Popular public DNS servers (provided by Google)
* NS lookup:
   * Nslookup command outputs DNS IP address
      * Runs interactive mode, type in an address to see the public information for that address from the DNS server
      * Can change active server when an interactive mode 
      * If you get a time out from the console, the IP address being used is not a functional DNS server
      * In the event of time-outs when using the nslookup command, change servers or call network administrator/DNS service provider to resolve the issue
* * Use ipconfig /all command to see a system’s DNS servers
* You can statically configure DNS and still use DHCP for IP addressing
* Have an alternative public DNS server in case your DNS server is down
* Use nslookup to verify a DNS server is running




WINDOWS NAMING:


* Netbios/NetBT
   * Workgroup vs active domain
   * Control panel: system
   * Go to settings to change computer name / workgroup or domain name using the change settings dialogue box
   * Using a workgroup is useful for small LANs
   * Use servers to establish a domain:
      * “Windows server system”
         * Active directory domain
         * Security, central administration
         * Powerful
         * Expensive
   * Homegroup:
      * In between work group and active directory domain
      * No longer used
* Windows systems are members of network organizations
   * Workgroups:
      * Very basic; no security, no administration, 
   * Active directory domains:
      * Install windows server software
      * Establish domain
   * Homegroup:
      * No longer used
      * More automation / administration than workgroup


* Windows naming is designed for LANs
* When you install windows, you give the computer a windows name
* All windows systems will be a member of a domain or a workgroup
* Homegroups are a more secure and automated organization, but still a workgroup


ROUTERS:


* Routers are devices that filter and forward network traffic based on IP addresses
   * Used to connect LANs
   * Routing table used to direct incoming traffic
   * Use a default gateway to send out traffic if the network ID is not specified
   * Looks at destination address and sends out the traffic through another port
   * Main internet traffic pathway
* Home routers usually have switches and wireless access points into one box
* DOCSIS; some routers have upstream connections using cable modems
* Configuring routers:
   * Console port: serial port RJ45 to DB-9 connector that goes to the computer to communicate with the router; “Yost” “Rollover cable”
   * Use terminal software like PuTTy to configure the router
* SOHO (small office / home office) router:
   * DHCP range
   * Change the default username and password
* Connecting to router:
   * The default gateway is your router
   * Use a web browser to connect to the router IP address and access configuration settings


* Routers filter and forward traffic based on IP addresses
* A routing table determines where to filter or forward IP packets
* Every routing table has a default gateway that sends all data unless otherwise specified
* A SOHO router is usually far more than a router; switch, wireless access point, etc
* Some routers use web connections, some use console ports


BASIC ROUTER CONFIGURATION:


* Check the status screen for overall information
* WAN Most routers are DHCP clients (dynamic IP addressing)
* LAN; can change internal network ID
   * Routers will automatically change all addressing information for the system
* Advanced settings: system tools
   * Dhcp server; what addresses for router to pass out
   * Router usually takes DNS server default addresses to distribute to clients
* DHCP reservation:
   * Range of addresses to distribute to clients
   * To not pass out specific addresses; not common to do so.
   * Not necessary to set reservations; use .1 for the router address, use single digits addresses for devices you want to give fixed addresses to (file server, cameras, etc.)
* System tools:
   * Time settings NTP servers
   * Diagnostics
   * Firmware updates
   * Administration
      * New usernames and passwords
   * Local management:
      * Settings to deter unwanted connections to the LAN router
   * Enable remote management (WAN) (off by default)
      * Change web management port
      * Use address to get to router configuration screen
      * Not smart to enable remote management; safer to physically connect to the router to change configurations


* Configure both the WAN and LAN connections on your router
* Avoid default settings for basic configurations (IP, SSID, password, etc.)
* Don’t create too large of an DHCP pool
* DHCP reservations set aside IP addresses in the DHCP pool




ADVANCED ROUTER CONFIGURATION:


* Quality of service:
   * Limited bandwidth; allows you to meter bandwidth to different types of traffic
   * QoS:
      * Select port
      * Select uplink and download speed
      * Set priorities by PORT number, IP address or MAC address; premium is higher than the rest
* Universal Plug and Play (UPnP):
   * Makes router easily visible to networks
* Link Layer Discovery Protocol:
   * On windows by default
* Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP):
   * Used by network administrators for critical network information
   * Very powerful tool


* Quality of Service (QoS) gives control on network bandwidth by many different criteria
* Link layer discovery protocol (LLDP) and Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) help with network device identification
* Simple network management protocol enables querying of network devices




VLANs:
* Virtual local area network:
   * Takes one physical switch and virtually creates two or more switches
   * Separate network traffic on the same box
   * Managed switch:
      * Switches use MAC addresses; give the switch an IP address to manage and configure the switch
      * Use DHCP from the router to find the switch IP address, then access the switch via a web browser
      * Might be useful to use MS Internet Explorer to configure switches
      * Setup VLAN:
         * Define the VLANs (most switches have 2 by default)
         * Assign the network traffic per VLAN
         * Select the ports for the traffic you want to direct to different VLAN
      * Port security settings:
         * Declare which computers and ports can access the switch
         * Undeclared systems will not work with the switch


* VLANs enable network segmentation without adding hardware
* Configure VLAN-capable switches via IP address and Web browser


NETWORK TROUBLESHOOTING (FOR WIRED NETWORKS):


* No connectivity:
   * Check all physical connectors and cables
   * Check network / IP addressing for IP conflicts (static addresses might conflict)
      * Look for IP conflict error messages
   * Use ping command
* Limited connectivity: check DHCP status;
   * If there is a 169.254 IP address there is a problem with the DHCP server
   * If your IP address changes from one session to the next, check for ROGUE DHCP server
* Intermittent Connectivity:
   * Check for any problems with connectors, cables, and interference; replace or move cable to resolve
* Unavailable Resources:
   * Ping the system 
   * Check for problems with the shared resource (common issue accessing folders)




* Slow transfer speeds:
   * Common issue in wireless networks but can show up in wired connections
   * Check task manager and see loads/processes on the network card
   * Remove load on network card / end intensive processes if they are not needed at the moment (such as updating games in the background)
*
