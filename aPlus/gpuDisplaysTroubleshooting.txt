GRAPHICS CARDS:

- GPU: graphics processing unit
- modern graphics cards use more powerful RAM chips and processors
- Nvidia Corp. and ATI/AMD are major graphics card manufactureres
	- Intel also makes graphics cards but they are not as popular; designed to work on the actual motherboard itself
- majority of motherboards today have integrated GPUs
- AMD packages a CPU with a GPU as an APU
- common for motherboards today to have their own RAM to be able to handle talking to the GPU
- Connectors to graphics cards:
	- VGA (Video Graphics Array); blue 15pin connector; analog signal
	- DVI (Digital Visual Interface); digital signal; DVI to VGA connectors for older systems 
	->DVI-I (digital and analog)
	- DVI-D -> digital only throughput
	- single link DVI and Dual link DVI
		- dual link allows for output to 2 monitors or 1 high res monitors
- Digital Rights Management:
	- HDMI (High Definition Multimedia Interface)
		- video and audio
		- solves some digital rights issues
		- mini-hdmi for smaller devices
		- automatic configurations
	- Display port used for dedicated video card throughput
		- competitor to HDMI 
		- also has mini-display port

- multiple connectors on a graphics card for versatility with multiple monitors
- make sure to use the default port for initial startup

- Nvidia, AMD (ATI) and Intel make the majority of GPUs
- all graphics cards have RAM to help resolve the screen
- many CPUs come with built-in GPUs
- VGA uses an analog signal; DVI uses a digital signal


INSTALLING A GRAPHICS CARD:

- try to use the default connector first
- plug into PCIe slots
- make sure all screws are tightened
- make all PCIe power connections
- on bootup, go to CMOS:
	- select which GPU to boot from; default setting is usually to boot from motherboard GPUs

- Riser card:
	- PCIe 16 lane on one side, PCIe single lane on the other end of the connector
	- expansion for more graphics cards
	
- inital boot:
	- go to device manager to make sure GPU is recognized
	- make sure the graphics card is compatible with the native resolution of the monitor used
	- make sure to run in native resolution
	- can use scaling of graphical displays
	- pull latest drivers from manufacturer website to update
	
- almost all graphics cards use 16-lane PCIe slots and one or two PCIe power connectors
- with multiple graphics cards, define the primaryu card in system setup
- some systems provide riser cards for extra graphics cards
- always run the sytem at your monitor's native resolution


PROJECTORS:

- monitor projected onto a surface
- use common connectors to the system unit
- have their own graphics cards
- DLP and LCD projectors
- all have integrated light sources: sold by brightness rating measured in Lumens
- LED bulbs last longest
- throw:
	- projection best distance from screen
	- pin cushion style lenses
	- key stone lenses 
	- skew lenses

- bulbs, throw, and adjustments

- prjectors have rsolutions and aspect ratios just like monitors
- projectors usually have either DLP or LCD technology
- lumens define the brightness of the projector
- make sure to understand throw, pin cushion, keystone, and skew type projector lenses



TROUBLESHOOTING MONITORS:

- Overheat Shutdown:
	- GPU gets hot and shuts down:
		- make sure fans are functioning correctly
		- make sure GPU has enough air flow / ventilation
- Dead pixels:
	- occurs in LCD monitors
	- dead pixels in the center of screen call for a return to the manufacturer
	- all manufacturers tolerate a certain number of dead pixels per company warranty
		
- Artifacts:
	- data on the screen that does not belong / did not refresh 
	- make sure video RAM is functioning properly
	- test with a working GPU to single out RAM deficit; will need to be replaced as gpu RAM is usually soldered in
		
- Incorrect color patterns:
	- check all connections first
	- check GPU RAM by using a working GPU
	
- DIM image:
	-  not enough light output
	- replace CCFL
	- check brightness settings

- Flickering Image:
	- check all cables and connectors
	- replace cables if needed; hdmi connectors can wear out

- Distorted Image:
	- make sure monitor is running at native resolution
	- for projectors, make sure lenses geometry is adjusted correctly

- Burn-In:
	- old plasma monitors had tech specifically for repairing image burn in
	- LCD monitors may get "image persistence"; change the image on the screen for LCD to correct itself

- Oversized images and Icons:
	- adjust text size/icon size  in system settings

- the CompTIA exams cover many monitor trouble shooting situations
- all above issues will be in the exam
- make sure to memorize how to troubleshoot monitors
