MOTHERBOARDS:

Form Factors:
	- standardized system unit specs to mount hardware
	- I/O area
	- ATX is biggest common form factor 12in by 9.6in
	- MicroATX 9.6x9.6
	- Mini-ITX form factor (smallest common form factor)
	- ITX form factor (larger version of mini itx form factor)

	- power supplies have standardized connectors
	- I/O shields share a standardized size; doesn't matter how big the system unit case is, 99% shields fit 99% of cases



CHIPSETS:
	- special purpose chips: northbridge / southbridge
	- northbridge did fast jobs
	- southbridge connections to slower jobs
	- CPUs today take care of northbridge functions
	- chipsets determine what hardware you can attach to the motherboard
	- Chipsets combine functions from many single-function chips
	- Early chipsets offered northbridge and southbridge
	- Modern chipsets feature Southbridge (CPU handles northbridge functions)
	- Chipsets determine RAM capacity, USB capabilities, and more hardware attachments/interfaces

MOTHERBOARD TOUR:
	- motherboard book makes set up and documentation easily accessible
	- most include some extra cables
	- SATA cables for hard drives or SSDs go into the SATA HDD connectors
	- power connecctors, chip sockets (check the type so its compatible with your cpu)
	- capacitors:
		- voltage regulator modules
		- make sure capacitors are in good flat shape
	- PCIe expansion slots:
		- allows for hardware installation such as video cards
		- 16 lane PCIe connector: uses serial connections
		- parallel vs serial; serial is more efficient / reliable data transfer
		- single lane PCIe socket; smaller PCIe devices can be placed into larger PCIe slots without a problem
		- single lane 1X 16 lane is X16
		- X4 PCIe has 4 lanes
	- USB connectors; pin outs near the edges of the motherboard
		- use dongles to complete the connectors
		- serial connector dongle
		- VGA connector dongle
	- ssd m.2 drive connectors on the motherboard
	- may not use all of the connectors
	- connectors for RGB
	- motherboards come with a lot of connectors and dongles out of the box.
	- The motherboard manual provides essential setup information
	- Motherboards come with cables, standard connectors, and more
	- PCIe is the most common expansion BUS, it offers multiple lnes

TOURING THE SYSTEM UNIT CASE:
	- tower case; for storing many hard drives
	- front pannel connections have various connectors audio usb audio etc
	- standouts are standardized screw locations to mount the motherboard
	- pass through
	- hard drive mounts
	- front panel connector cables run through the inside of the case and out of the way through the pass throughs
	- cable management is important for organization and presentation
	- power supply opening for mounting the power supply box and other hard drives
	- slots for 2.5in hard drives
	- fans located on more than one panel of the system unit box
	- some cases do or do not have slots for mounting and optical drive
	- cases offer standardized standouts for mounting various motherboard form factors
	- better cases offer cable management features
	- pick a case that has support for number and types of drives that you will use for your system.

MOUNTING THE MOTHERBOARD TO THE CASE:
	- test the motherboard with peripherals before mounting to the case
	- mount the I/O shield
	- clear the case of any cables to make room to mount the motherboard
	- line up the board with the standoffs and I/O plate  on the case  
	- make necessary cable connections after mounting the motherboard
	- use motherboard docs / case docs for cable mappings
	- fan connectors have 3 or 4 pins
	- install and test CPU and RAM on motherboard before mounting to case
	- install I/O shield and triple check standoff positions
	- mount motherboard and connect motherboard cables
	- use the motherboard manual if necessary
	-
