Wireless Network Hardware:


* IEEE 802.11 Standard for wireless networks:
   * Primary method for wireless communication
   * Common among all 802.11 setups:
      * Wireless access point (WAP)
      * Acts as bridge between ethernet network and wireless networks
      * Usually has only 1 connection (routers have multiple functions/connections)
   * Infrastructure mode:
      * 1 or more WAPs
      * Wireless network card
      * Laptops usually have wireless network antenna built into the monitor
      * Service set identifier (SSID)
         * Serve as names / identifiers of wireless networks
   * Adhoc mode:
      * Use a machine / pc that acts as a wireless access point for other computers to connect to (but there is no WAP involved);
         * Does not necessarily involve providing internet access
   * Antennas:
      * Omni-directional; spreads in all directions
      * Dipole: 
         * 2 omni-directional antennas that are pointed directly opposite of eachother
         * Big flat circular signal very useful for WAP
      * Patch:
         * Flat looking; good for placing on wall and outward from wall
      * Highly directional:
         * Yagi; long distance signal throws in shape of football
         * Parabolic antenna
* A wireless access point (WAP) bridges 802.11 and ethernet networks
* Wireless clients connect to WAP
* 802.11 works in one of two modes: infrastructure mode or ad hoc mode
* Use correct antenna from list above for the correct application of signal propagation 


WIFI STANDARDS
* Extensions to standard 802.11 to support newer tech and better speed
* Based on Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) radios bands
   * 2.4 GHz band
   * 5 GHz band
   * Band: range of radio frequencies
      * 2.412-2.4884
      * channels : 14 different channels that takes a different piece of each band
      * JPN has 14, EU  has 13, USA has 11
      * 5.150 - 5.875
         * 36-64 segmented
