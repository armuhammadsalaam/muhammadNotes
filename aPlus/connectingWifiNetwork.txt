Connecting to a Wifi Network:
	- check SSID and security type / password
	- check visibility
	- make sure network card is not disabled
	- wifi profiles listed will be saved for future connectivity
		- make sure to update and/or forget networks that are no longer useful
	- Issues with connecting to an SSID
		1. NIC is configured as DHCP client
		2. Passwords can change
		3. Set wireless NIC to a static IP address
	- can configure WAP completely remotely

RECAP:
	- All wireless clients can scan the 802.11 spectrum, finding available SSIDs
	- You must know the SSID and password to connect
	- Clients create profiles that store the SSIDs and their passwords
