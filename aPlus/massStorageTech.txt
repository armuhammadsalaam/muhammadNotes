MASS STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES:
	
	- optical media, magnetic disks, SSD etc
	- all storage devices have LBA (logical block addressing)
	- piece of hardware on storage devices with software to determine data storage location per the block architecture (addressing)
	- each block is 4096 bytes
	- LBA will allocate however many blocks of storage needed per file, and determine the location/address of those blocks for that file
	- LBA is inherent to all OS
	- Capacity:
		- 2^10 =  1024 bytes = KILO byte kebi
		- 2^20 = MEGAbytes mebi
		- 2^30 = GIGAbytes gebi
		- 2^40 = TERAbytes tebi

	- 5.25in hard drive format optical media
	- 3.5in mass storage is the dominant formfactor
	- 2.5in mass storage mostly used in laptops and mobile devices, or as external storage
	- 1.8in mass storage
	- m.2 is dominant format for SSD devices
	- LBA for all systems
	- Capacity is important depending on your system/purpose
	
	- There are many types of mass storage used today, including hard drives, solid state drives, and optical media
	- Regardless of the media, your OS sees mass storage as a string of logical block addresses LBA
	- There is a difference between decimal values and IEC values (refer to notes at top; refer to online documenation for more details.

CLASSIC MAGNETIC DRIVES:

	- stores information within sectors of the disk
	- HDD hard disk drive (has to have something spinning on the inside)
	- 3.5 and 2.5 are the main sizes capacitites as low as 20Mb, modern drives hold as much as 16 Tb
	- Advanced technology attachment for older drives
	- modern drives use seriel ATA or SATA
	- SATA connector composed of power connector and data connector
	- SATA plugs into the motherboard; motherboards have built in SATA controls
	- can use any of the SATA connectors on the motherboard
	- SATA is so popular that there is form factors for external storage devices eSATA
	- eSATA connections designed to be used externally
		- goes from I/O to external storage
	- eSATA expansion card that snaps into motherboard to make it accessible
	- should be visible in the system setup if successfully plugged in
	- boot into the system setup to find where the external drives are located; lists the ports where the connections are if correctly installed
	- magnetic disk drives use spinning platters to store data via magnetism and read/write heads
	- hard disk drives come in 3.5, 2.5, and 1.8in physical sizes
	- use the Advanced TEchnology Attachment protocol to communicate with hard disk drives
	- the dominant ATA is called Serial ATA (SATA) 


SOLID STATE DRIVES (SSD):
	- becoming the dominant form factor for booting systems
	- 2.5in format is most common, composed of chips 
	- m.2 ssd is a smaller form factor
	- common problems concern interfaces; very fast compared to HDD
	- NVMe Non-Volatile Memory Express; commonly m.2 drives; much faster than the SATA connection
	- type of SSD will be stated directly on packaging
	- make sure the motherboard has the type of connection you need for your mass storage
	- m.2 one notch is NVMe; usually directly on the motherboard
	- proper installation shows up in the system setup
	- SSDs store data using chips; there are no moving parts
	- Data is stored in blocks and pages

SCSI:
	- small computer systems interface; uses a parallel interface with its own type of connector, competed with ATA, incompatible
	- most connections today are in serial connections
	- SCSI used today is a specific type called Serial Attached SCSI or SAS for short 
 	- not compatible with SATA
	- not popular yet appears in systems
	- ISCSI connected to system via ethernet cable, not usually on a desktop setup
	- the small computer sytstems interface SCSI is an ancient standard that still has great suppost
	- the old paralle scsi is long gone, but the scsi language lives on in serial scsi versions
	- two modern scsi standards are SAS (serial attached SCSI) and iSCSI (ethernet/network cable  connection)

BOOT ORDER:
	
	- looks for storage device from which to boot after going through the POST test
	- can select any mass storage device to boot from, you can set a boot order to boot another storage device if present or absent
	- define the boot order in the system setup
		- make sure the system recognizes all of the storage devices
		- "board explorer" on some systems
		- check to see if all mass storage devices are recognized by the connections to the motherboard
		- check SATA connections, m.2 connections, USB connections
		- define the boot priority list
		- go into the boot menu to check the order; most systems do not boot off UEFI mode
		- most PCs will usually try to boot off the USB connections first
	- when a system boots, it look for a bootable device
	- it's importan to make sure the system looks for the correct boot devices
	- the boot order is definded in the CMOS system setup

	- storage is organized into Logical Block Addresses (LBAs)
	
	- ATA (advanced technology attachment) is a standard command and connection standard for mass sotrage devices
	- SERIAL DATA TRANSFER PROTOCOL: data is transferred one bit at a time from the drive to the computer and one bit at a time from the computer to the drive. 
	- SSDs are organized into logical blocks, but their memory storage cells are called PAGES
	- MAGNETIC drive storage units are called SECTORS
	- NVMe uses PCIe lanes and is the fastest of these interface choices. PATA is slowest; SATA and SCSI speeds fall between NVMe and PATA
	- Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) uses the SATA connector with the SCSI command language. 
	- M.2 is a connector interface and form factor
	- iSCSI uses SCSI commands sent over Ethernet.
	- UEFI is a firmware interface, not a boot device
	- a computer cannot boot from a non-bootable device or media
