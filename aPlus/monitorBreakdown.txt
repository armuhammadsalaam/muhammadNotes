Monitor Technologies:

- main output device
- composed of pixels:
	- picture elements
	- liquid crystal display LCD
	- Red, Green, Blue on each pixel
	- simply allows light to pass through or blocks light to create the overall image on the monitor
	- needs backlight to operate
	- LEDs (light emitting diodes) used in modern monitor systems

- Resolution:
	- resolution is fixed per monitor

- Brightness measured in Nits (200-500)

- Response time 1ms-4ms

- OLED (organic LED); has 3 lights per RGB; for thin monitors and small devices; 

- DLP (digital light processing)
	-  grid of tiny mirrors that defines the resolution
	- common in projector technologies
	
- a monitor is composed of individual picture elements (pixels); the total pixels across and down is the resolution
- Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) monitors use liquid crystals to allow light to pass or not pass for each color in a pixel
- lcd backlights are fluorescent or LED lights and shine through the liquid crystals
- organic LED (OLED) doesn't use a backlight, as the pixels make their own light
- Digital light processing (DLP) uses a grid of tiny mirrors that shine through a color wheel to create an image

LCD BREAKDOWN:

- LCD panel is the largest piece of monitor with attached pcb and controller chips
- CCFL tubes under white panel to provide light
- power connector and inputs on the back of the screen
- ONLY CCFL SCREENS NEED INVERTERS


- WHEN WORKING WITH AN LCD PANEL:
	- Panel
	- separate backlight unit; remember that CCFL monitors need a power inverter to operate
	- connectors
	- input from data connection
	- power connection

- LCD panels have a preset resolution
- the back panel backlight unit distributes the light emanating from the CCFL or LED backlights
- inverters convert DC power back into AC power for fluorescent lights; LEDs do not need inverters
