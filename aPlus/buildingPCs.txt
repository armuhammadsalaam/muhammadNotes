BUILDING A PC:

- Standard Thick Client:
	- most basic type of desktop computer
	- use hardware that meets recommded requirements for selected OS
		- includes motherboard, processor, storage, RAM, and OS, expansion cards
	- Desktop applications
	
- Standard thin client:	
	- operates mainly through network connectivity; rarely relies on its internal storage to operate
	- hardware:
		- motherboard with good network connectivity Gb
		- meets minimum(recommnded) requirements for selected OS; 
	- does not use its own storage to keep its applications/programs
	- thin systems will have at least basic applications installed; sometimes only need specialized in-house applications
	
	
	- build a Graphic/CAD/CAM Design Workstation:
		- usually includes powerful multi-core processor and high-end video card 
		- hardware:
			- multicore processor
			- high-end video card
			- maximum RAM
	
- Virtualization Workstation:
	- Maximum RAM and CPU cores
	- hardware needed:
		- high-end motherboard and processor
		- compatible OS
		- extra storage drives
	
- building Network Attached Storage (NATS):
	- headless system
	- file sharing is main purpose
	- not many peripherals connected during uptime
	- hardware needed:
		- Gigabit NIC
		- RAID array
		- midrange motherboard
		- midrange CPU
		- Gigabit ethernet network expansion card
		- minimum of 4 drives for a stable large RAID system storage
	- no peripherals needed after initial setup
	- connect to it through the network

- build a Gaming PC:
	- requires a strong multi-core processor
	- strong motherboard
	- high-end power supply
	- high-end cooling
	- high-end video and specialized GPU; use SLI to take advantage of 2 video cards on the same system unit / monitor
	- high definition sound card
	- large mass storage; combo of SSD and HDD
	
- build an Audio and Video Workstation:
	- hardware:
		- specialized audio and video card
		- large, fast hard drive
		- dual monitors
		- Macs offer good out of the box hardware for audio and video workstations
	
	
THE EXAM WILL TEST DETAILS ABOUT EACH SPECIALIZED BUILDING

- consider different jobs and make sure the system matches the job specs
- concentarate on RAM, storage, and graphics needs
