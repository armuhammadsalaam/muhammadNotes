PS/2 - Mini DIN connectors:
	-older types of round ports commonly used for keyboards and mice

LPT or Parallel Port:
	-used mainly for printers

Serial Port:
	-different peripheral devices

VGA Display Ports:
	-mainly for display monitors

USB 2 / USB 3

RJ 45 is the common type of port for  ethernet cable and other network connections

various round jacks for input from microphones and output for speakers and headphones

CPUs:
	- central processing units run programs
	- every CPU has internal features to process commands
	- every CPU runs code based on a specific machine language
	- CPUs use pipelines to optimize the processing commands

	- CPUs have a clock speed commonly measured in GHz (billion cycles per second)
	- 2 major manufacturers Intel and AMD
	- CPUs take a system speed and multiply it to reach the desired/MAX clock speed
	- Overclocking takes the default clock speed and tells CPU to work harder by multiplying the clock speed outside of default range
	- Single CPUs often have multiple cores
	
System Cache:
	- temporary system storage used to reconcile lag between cpu and ram (cpu ram called sram)
	- used to avoid pipeline stalls
	- 3 types of cache
		- lvl 1 cache: only about 64Kb of ram, as fast as system clock speed
		- lvl 2 cache: 'feeds' lvl 1 cache. More space 128Kb,256Kb, etc; runs about half of system clock speed 
		- lvl 3 cache: space in the Mb, runs at base motherboard speed, lower rate than lvl 1 and lvl 2 system cache, and system RAM itself

 CPU SOCKETS: PGA or LGA
	- PGA pin grid array
	- LGA land(pads) grid array

INTEL vs AMD:
	- INTEL 2 SOCKET TYPES
		LGA 1151 mainstream type of socket
		LGA 2066 enthusiast level cpu
	- AMD 2 Socket types:
		AMA 4 avg to enthusiast level
		TM 4 powerful work station/ enthusiast level
-CPU sockets are the mount where a CPU connects to the motherboard

-CPUs have different microarchitectures as manufacturers improve their designs
-many different CPUs come from a single microarchitecture
-there are specific CPU socket packages covered on the A+

INSTALLING A CPU:
	- motherboard has to have the correct socket that processor has
	- motherboard has to be able to operate / handle the speed of the processor
	- always use thermal paste between he CPU and the fan 
	- connect the fan to a power source
	- fans:
		- third party fans are often more efficient than OEM fans from the manufacturer
		- liquid cooling uses a pump, a radiator, and a cooling block with liquid to remove heat 
		- liquid cooling reduces fan noise

TYPES OF RAM: make sure to use ram that operates with same type of RAM and compatible with  speed of motherboard clock
	- PC speed rating is always 8x speed of DDR speed
	- Use PC speed rating to determine what type of ram to use ex. PC2-speed will use DDR2 PC-speed uses DDR
	- SDRAM synchronous data ram operates at the speed of the system clock; 168 pins
	- DDR RAM double data rate goes double the speed of the system clock; 184 pins
	- DDR 2 is double the speed of DDR and 4x speed of SDRAM; 240 pins
	- DDR 3 is double the speed of DDR2 and 8x speed of SDRAM; 240 pins
	- DDR 4 usually measured in Bandwidth MT/s Megatransfers per second; 288 pins
		 ex clock speed of 266Hz will have a bandwidth of 2133 MT/s. 
		* the machine I use is a 2133 speed ram DDR4

RAM Capacity:
	- single or double sided ram
	- channels:
		- dual channel memory; needs a stick in each channel to operate as fast as system can operate
	- motherboards offer multichannel memory
	- RAM should be identical in the same channel


PARITY /  ECC RAM:
	- error correction code 
	- ECC allows for operation in the event of 2 bad chips
		- parity only allows 1 chip
	- motherboard needs to be ECC capable out of the box

SO-DIMM :
	- smaller form factor RAM commonly used in laptops
	- same ram tech, smaller form factor
	- DDR 3 and DDR 4 use consistent pin counts

SERIAL PRESENCE DETECT (SPD) Chip:
	- system chip that allows for query of RAM specs information
	- Tools like CPU-Z for windows/mac or CPU-X for Linux read SPD information

TO INSTALL RAM 
	- Use the motherboard book to use the correct type and speed of ram to use.
	- Line up notches in correct channel according to the motherboard book
	- Boot up the system to see if the motherboard recognizes the added ram.
	- Make sure the ram is fully installed and the channels are properly filled
