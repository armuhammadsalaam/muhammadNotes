Firewalls and Servers:

	- web is not the only part of the internet
	- client computer goes to cloud (internet)
	- server also connected to the internet
	- to open a webpage on a server
		- client computer tries to open webpage hosted on a server
		- the host based firewall will:
			- any outbound port 80 webpages 
			- router has to allow outgoing port 80
			- router blocks incoming port 80
			- firewall allows outgoing port 80, blocks incoming port 80
			- server listens to incoming port 80
			- sents it back with a source port number so the firewall does not block it
			- server has to be left open for incoming port 80
		- home routers block incoming port 80 because clients usually do not have any web servers.

RECAP: 
	- all internet connections require a client and a server
	- one of the primary functions of firewalls is to block ports
	- client and server networks use firewalls
	- firewalls block ports on an incoming vs outgoing concept
	- servers must not block incoming ports on the ports to which they listen
