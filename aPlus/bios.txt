The BIOS:

	- Basic Input/Output Services
	- BIOS programming enables interaction with the motherboard before the OS boots
	- firmware (as opposed to software) programming burned onto motherboard
	- backup bios usually on another chip
	- bios used to check assumed hardware before booting the OS
	- Power on self test POST routines are built into firmware
	- System Setup (CMOS) utility is also part of the firmware

POST:

	- power good wire talks to BIOS to run power on self test
	- self diagnostic for all assumed hardware before booting up
	- system unit beeps after POST from a mini-speaker
	- if post returns an error, beep codes when machine has no video card or display
	- no RAM beep code until machine is powered off
	- display codes will display on the screen for errors
	
POST cards:
	- hexidecimal two digit code readout
	- refer to the motherboard book for (q-codes)  post error codes
	- post codes only valid as machine boots up
	- POST runs at boot, requesting devices to self check
	- POST erros manifest as specific beep codes or display (text) codes
	- POST cards enable testing of "dead" computers

SYSTEM SETUP:

	- Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)
	- supplanted BIOS; 
	- in the case of a change in hardware, System Setup is an interface to make changes of changeable part of BIOS
	- hold down a key before the OS boots
	- "press DEL or F2" immediately; takes you to system setup
	- main section shows basic specs and motherboard info
	- main/security allows you to set up an administrator password; needed for critical OS functions and changing of BIOS settings; "supervisor password"
	- setting only the USER password prevents boot without using a password; system password/power-on password
	- can set overclocking setting
	- advanced settings:
		- on board device configurations
		- turn off sound card
		- mass storage devices
		- disable specific connections
		- disable network cards
		- serial port settings
	- boot settings:
		- secure boot options to boot from specific devices
		- disable specific boot options
	- tool settings:
		- access flash utilities to flash new BIOS firmware to the motherboard
		- update/flash BIOS
		- can update from a storage device or the web
	- UEFI replaces traditional 16-bit BIOS in modern systems
	- System Setup enables custom information about changeable devices
	- System Setup enables changes to CPU frequencies (overclocking) RAM timings, BIOS passwords, boot options (i.e boot options/boot from USB)

TROUBLESHOOTING FIRMWARE:

	- Single Flash ROM chips (flash memory) stores the troubleshooting firmware
	- can flash or reprogram the ROM chip
	- RTC real time clock
	- every motherboard has a built in CMOS battery to keep chips like the RTC alive even when unplugged
	- the system needs a good battery in order to keep accurate track of time 
	- if the battery dies, all of the updated system information fails/disappears
	- resolve by installing a new battery CR 2032 
	- can change settings without saving the settings before exiting the firmware
	- some systems include preset system tuning
	- look for default settings button to reset settings to default
	- Flashing the ROM updates the firmware on flash chip 
		- make sure you will not lose power while flashing the ROM chip
		- make sure you have a complete BIOS flash image
		- make sure you know why you are updating
		- some motherboards have 2 BIOS chips in case one fails
		- update through storage device or update via the internet; accept the warning prompts
		- update to accept new technology cpu ram, usb firmware updates
		- go to manufacturer website and research firmware updates for a particular motherboard
	
	- RTC battery keeps system time without external power
	- System setup allows for changes, exit without saving is an option
	- Reset System Settings for defaults
	- Flash the ROM chip to update firmware
