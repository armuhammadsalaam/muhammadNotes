INTRODUCTION TO NETWORKING:


* Local Area Networks (LAN):
   * All system units are hard-wired to a central system unit.
   * Modern version uses wifi-access-point (WAP).
* Ethernet network:
   * Developed in the 1970s
   * Very popular today for network connectivity
   * Data throughput in discrete chunks of 1500 bites
   * Frame: the chunks of 1500 bites
* Identify system units on the LAN with MAC (media access control) address; 12 hexadecimal characters
   * Every network card has a unique MAC address
   * First 6 characters of MAC address are OEM ID
   * Windows cmd: ipconfig /all
      * “Physical address” is MAC address of network card
   * MacOS and Linux cmd: ifconfig 19
* ETHERNET FRAME STRUCTURE FOR NETWORK THROUGHPUT:
   * OEM ID + SOURCE MAC + DATA + FCS (frame check sequence)


* LAN computers connect with Ethernet
* Ethernet frames standardized as 1500 bytes
* A MAC address uniquely identifies a host on a LAN
* Use windows cmd ipconfig or Linux cmd ifconfig to view MAC




HUBS VS SWITCHES:


* Hub takes input from a system unit and repeats it to be shared with other system units on the LAN
* Hub has a max throughput of 10 MB/s to be split among all pcs on the network
* Switch:
   * Stores all MAC addresses
   * Takes frames from origin pc and makes a physical connection to destination pc on the network
   * Allows for faster throughput because the connections are not shared
   * More common and more efficient than hubs; hubs are not common in most modern systems
* Hub repeats throughput and shares connection speed with all computers on the network
* Switch repeats throughput but makes a physical connection to destination pc


* Hubs repeat all traffic on the LAN to all nodes
* Switches filter traffic based on MAC addresses
* Switches provide full bandwidth for all nodes


HEXADECIMALS:


* Complete base 16 numbering system used for throughput communication to relieve binary number bloating
* Every hexadecimal value represents 4 binary number values
* MAC address consists of 12 hexadecimal values for a 48bit physical address


* Hexadecimal base 16 enables discussion of long strings of binary 1s and 0s
* Each hex character represents 4 binary numbers
* In hex, numbers goes from 0-9, a-f, for 0-15 inclusive






WAN (WIDE AREA NETWORKS) AND ROUTERS:


* Routers:
   * Sensitive to different local area networks
   * Logical addressing:
      * User defined LAN identifier
      * Different ports on the router go to different LAN
      * “IP addressing”
   * DHCP to automatically configure addressing
* MAC address for LAN, IP address to communicate outside the LAN


* Switches connect up to 1024 computers in a LAN (most common max computers on a LAN is 30-40
* Routers connect multiple LANs together in a WAN
* Routers use logical addressing (IP) to determine local vs remote traffic
CABLES AND CONNECTORS:


* Wired connections are the backbone of how LAN and internet works
* Ethernet is the most common networking method
* DOCSIS (used for cable modems)
* 10BaseT (10Mbps baseband twisted pair)
* Coaxial cable:
   * RG ratings 
      * RG 58: older style BNC connector
      * RG 59
      * RG 6: f-type connector
* Unshielded twisted pair (UTP)
   * Common to run for 100m
   * RJ 11: older style telephone cable connector with 4 contacts
   * RJ 45: newer style ethernet connector with 8 contacts
* Shielded twisted pair (STP)
   * Uses RJ 45 connector
* Fiber optic cable:
   * Multimode (uses LED)
   * Singlemode (uses lasers): super long range
   * Has 2 connectors; send and receive


* CAT (category) ratings
   * CAT 5: 100 Mbps
   * CAT 5e: 1 Gbps
   * CAT 6: 1 Gbps up to 100m; also supports 10 Gbps up to 55m
   * CAT 6a: 10 Gbps at 100 m segments
* Plenum ratings (ability to resist heating/burning):
   * PVC (non-plenum)
* Riser ratings:
   * Between floors, not as resistant as plenum


* Coaxial cables use RG ratings and F-type connectors
* Most networks use twisted pair cabling
* Fiber optic cables use light, rather than electrical pulses
* Twisted pair cabling have different category (CAT) ratings




CRIMPING CABLES:
* Cables and crimps have to have matching CAT ratings
* Untwist the cables to be able to set them into the crimp
* TIA 568A / TIA 568B:
   * Both:
      * 8 - brown
      * 7 - brown white
      * 5 - blue white
      * 4 - blue
   * A:
      * 6 - orange
      * 3 - orange white
      * 2 - green
      * 1 - green white
   * B: 
      * 6 - green
      * 3 - green white
      * 2 - orange
      * 1 - orange white
* Line up all the untwisted wires, cut to .5in to insert into RJ 45 crimp
* Slide them in with the proper orientation (tab towards ground) then crimp with cable crimper
* Test with a cable tester:
   * Continuity
   * Wire map
* “Straight-through cable”; same standard on each end
* Crossover cable 568A at one end 568B at the other end
   * Plug two computers directly together with no cable


* Use a crimping tool to attach UTP cable to crimp (ex: RJ 45)
* Two standards: t568A t568B
* Straight-through cable has the same standard on each end
* Crossover cable has different standards on each end


STRUCTURED CABLING:


* Install cabling behind walls, floor, ceiling etc to maintain neat cabling that is easily accessible and non-hazardous
* Exists / originates in the MDF (main distribution frame)
   * 19in equipment rack very common in these rooms
      * Standardized heights known as “u”
      * Horizontal run:
         * Runs from the rack to the wall and connects to individual systems via a network cable RJ 45 style
         * Run the patch cable (RJ 45 connectors) from the patch panel to the switch box
            * uses RJ 45 connector patch cable from the patch panel to the switch box
         * Only effective within 90m (up to 10m of patch cable)
         * CONNECTING TO THE PATCH PANEL:
            * 110 punchdown tool
               * Follow diagram per panel to route wires from the network cable
      * Fox and hound (tone generator and tone probe):
         * Tracks down and locates cables
      * Time domain reflectometer (TDR)
         * Finds length of a cable
   * Solid Core cable runs through the walls
      * Each wire inside cable is a solid piece of copper
   * Stranded cabling for patch cables
      * Each of the 8 wires inside the cable is stranded copper
      * Very flexible
* Horizontal runs from wall outlet to patch panel through walls/ceilings
* Use punch-down tool to connect cable to patch panel
* Use tone generator/tone probe to locate cables
* Use TDR for testing runs; i.e find out to which jack the cable needs to connect to
