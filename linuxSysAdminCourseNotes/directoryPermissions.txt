Changing Permissions -

in Linux, the OS considers permissions as modes

		-u -g -o -a
		+ - = (add, remove, set permissions)
		rwx (read, write, execute)
	example command:
			chmod g+w fileName
				add writing permissions to group for file
** refer to documentation for info about octal/numerical codes **

	chgrp	change group ownership
	umask [-S] [mode]	sets file creation mask to mode if given
				-S symbolic notation
				takes away permissions
				** refer to docs **
