Use the cat command to output numerous files onto the console. use output  redirection to
combine those files into a new file.

example:
	cat file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt > file4.txt

above command will overwrite the destination file if it is not empty.

Use cat then pipe and sort output to a file:

	cat file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt | sort > file4.txt

Append files to the end of an existing file:

cat file5.txt >> file4.txt
